// token. This method is called when the token has changed, letting the sync service know it needs
// to go and fetch the updated token. Why does the GUI process not send the token to the sync
// service when it changes? A few reasons. First, if the sync service restarts for any reason, it
// will be left without a token. Second, the "active" GUI process is already being negotiated
// between the GUIs and the daemon. Having the sync service fetch the token, via the daemon,
// utilizes the already negotiated active GUI process for token retrieval.
