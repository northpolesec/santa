# Troubleshooting

This page outlines common troubleshooting steps for confirming proper Santa
daemon operation and steps to diagnose and correct common issues.

## Confirming Proper Santa Daemon Operation

The best way to start diagnosing the Santa daemon is by running:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/santactl status
```

If the daemon is up and running, you should see [normal status output](../binaries/santactl.md#status).

However, if you see a message like "`An error occurred communicating with the
Santa daemon...`", then use the following tips to diagnose the issue.

## Enabling Full Disk Access

The Santa daemon is required by the system to have "Full Disk Access" enabled
in order to function. On recent macOS versions, you can ensure this is enabled
using System Settings:

1. Open System Settings from the Apple menu
1. In the left pane, click on "Privacy & Security"
1. In the right pane, click on "Full Disk Access"
1. Ensure that `com.northpolesec.santa.daemon` is selected

If "Full Disk Access" wasn't enabled, re-check `santactl status` to see if the
issue is now resolved. Note that it may take up to 15 seconds for the daemon
to become active if no other issues are present.

## Enabling the System Extension

To confirm the Santa system extension is properly loaded, check the
output of the following command:

```sh
/usr/bin/systemextensionsctl list com.apple.system_extension.endpoint_security
```

Confirm that a line item exists for `com.northpolesec.santa.daemon` with the
expected version and the state is `activated enabled`.

If the extension is in the `activated waiting for the user` state, it must
first be approved to run using System Settings:

1. Open System Settings from the Apple menu.
1. In the left pane, click on "General"
1. In the right pane, click on "Login Items & Extensions"
1. Scroll to "Endpoint Security Extensions" and click the info button
1. Ensure that "Santa" is toggled on.

If Santa wasn't enabled, re-check `systemextensionsctl list`. If it's still
not in the `activated enabled` state, try forcing the extension to load:

```sh
/Applications/Santa.app/Contents/MacOS/Santa --load-system-extension
```

After loading, re-check the output of `systemextensionsctl list`. If issues
persist, reinstall Santa.

## Checking Santa Daemon Logs

The Santa daemon emits warning and error messages for encountered issues. If
it fails to start, check the logs for the cause. Daemon logs can be viewed
with the following command:

```sh
/usr/bin/log stream --level debug --predicate 'sender == "com.northpolesec.santa.daemon"'
```

## Enterprise Deployments

Enterprise deployments are typically managed via MDM, so administrators should
follow the guide on the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) page for
information on creating the necessary configuration profiles.

To diagnose a user device, administrators should first confirm that the MDM is
supervising the computer (via DEP or UAMDM) using the following command:

```sh
/usr/bin/profiles status -type enrollment
```

Profile payloads that require a supervision relationship cannot be applied
manually for testing. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure the MDM connection is
working as expected during mass deployments.

Additionally, confirm the system extension and TCC/PPPC profiles are present,
as described in the ["MDM-Specific Client Configuration"](configuration.md)
section of the Configuration page. After confirming that Santa is running, you
can verify that settings are being applied as expected by running
`santactl status`.

## Verifying Expected Functionality

Reviewing the [logs](../concepts/logs.md) is helpful for understanding Santa's
operation. The documentation on [scopes](../concepts/scopes.md) and
[rules](../concepts/rules.md) explains precedence and decision-making. To see
how Santa evaluates binary execution, use the santactl fileinfo command with a
binary path (see the [santactl docs](../binaries/santactl.md) for more
information):

```sh
/usr/local/bin/santactl fileinfo /path/to/binary
```
