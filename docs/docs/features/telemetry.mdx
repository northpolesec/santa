# Telemetry

Santa collects and outputs telemetry data about security events. This data is
used to provide insights into system activity, security events, and policy
enforcement decisions.

## Event Types

Santa can log various types of events based on system activity. The following
event types can be configured for logging:

:::warning

Some of these events are extremely noisy and will generate a lot of data.
`Fork`, `Exit`, and `Close`, in particular will generate a very large amount of
data, and should be used with caution.

:::

### Execution/Process

#### `Execution`

Binary execution events include detailed information about all allowed and
denied executions.

- The decision made by Santa
- The reason for the decision, which usually indicates the kind of rule that was
  matched when making the decision
- The SHA-256 hash of the binary, if available
- The signing certificate SHA-256 and common name, if available
- The team ID from the code signature, if available
- The pid, pidversion and ppid of the process
- User and group IDs
- The executable path
- The arguments passed to the binary

`protobuf` and `json` logs will include far more data, including:

- The working directory
- Environment variables
- File descriptors
- Entitlements

#### `Fork`

Process fork events, emitted every time any process calls `fork()` or
`posix_spawn()`. This is often a precursor to an execution.

#### `Exit`

Process exit events, emitted every time a process exits, regardless of reason or
state.

- pid, pidversion and ppid of the process
- The uid and gid of the process

#### `CodesigningInvalidated`

This event is emitted any time a signed binary is running and its signature
became invalid during execution. This usually indicates that some part of the
binary has been modified.

- The code-signing flags of the process will be logged

### File

#### `Close`

Emitted any time a file descriptor/handle is closed *and* was modified. This
event is also emitted if a file was ever mapped writable (though a file being
mapped writable does not necessarily mean that it was actually written to).

- The path of the file

#### `Rename`

Emitted any time a file is renamed/moved.

- The original path
- The new path

#### `Unlink`

Emitted whenever a file is deleted.

- The path of the file

#### `Link`

Emitted whenever a file is hard-linked.

:::tip[Symlinks do not trigger this event]
:::

- The path of the file
- The newly linked path

#### `ExchangeData`

Emitted any time a file is updated using the
[`exchangedata(2)`](https://www.manpagez.com/man/2/exchangedata/)
function. This is a macOS-specific syscall that atomically swaps the contents
of two files that was supported on HFS+ formatted drives; it is not supported
on the modern APFS filesystem.

- The original path of the file
- The new path

#### `Clone`

Emitted whenever a file is cloned using the
[`clonefile(2)`](https://www.manpagez.com/man/2/clonefile/) system call.

- The source path
- The target path

#### `CopyFile`

Emitted whenever a file is copied using the `copyfile(2)` syscall. This is an
undocumented call with no public API exposed, so it is not generally used.

- The source path
- The target path

### Other

#### `Disk`

Emitted whenever a disk is mounted or unmounted. This event can be emitted even
if [USB/SD Blocking](/features/usb-sd-blocking) is not enabled and can be
useful to see if users are attaching external storage devices that may need to
monitored or blocked.

- The mount path
- The volume name
- The BSD device name
- The filesystem type
- The model of the device the mount is from
- The serial number of the device the mount is from
- The bus/protocol that the device is mounted from, e.g. `USB`
- The DMG path, if the mount is from a disk image.


#### `Bundle`

Emitted whenever Santa creates a bundle hash for an application bundle. This
only occurs when an application bundle is blocked, Santa is configured to synchronize
with a sync server, that sync server has previously indicated that it supports
Bundles and the GUI is presented to the user.

Bundle hashing is a potentially expensive operation, and it can be useful to
have these bundle hashes available in analysis separately from the events
uploaded to the sync server.

- The bundle path
- The bundle name
- The bundle ID
- The bundle hash

#### `Allowlist`

Emitted whenever Santa creates a local allowlist rule for a binary created by an
allowed compiler. This will only occur if Transitive Allowlisting is enabled and
the host has one or more `ALLOWLIST_COMPILER` rules.

- The pid and pidversion of the process that created the binary
- The path of the new binary
- The SHA-256 of the binary


#### `FileAccess`

Emitted whenever a File Access Authorization event occurs.

See the [File Access](/features/faa) documentation for more
details.

- The policy name and version
- The accessed path
- The access type (read, write, execute, etc.)
- The decision that was made

#### `LoginWindowSession`

Emitted whenever a user logs in, logs out, or locks/unlocks the screen locally.

- The username associated with the session
- The graphical session ID

#### `LoginLogout`

Emitted whenever a user logs in or out for a console session. This is not a very
common event.

- Whether the user is logging in or out
- The associated user
- Whether the login was successful

#### `ScreenSharing`

Emitted whenever a screen sharing session is started or ended.

When a new session is started, the event will include:

- Whether the session was successfully established
- The IP address of the connecting user
- If the user is connecting through iCloud: their Apple ID
- What kind of authentication method was used
- The authenticating user
- The local username of the session
- Whether the connection was made to an existing session
- The graphical session ID

:::note

This event is only emitted if the built-in Screen Sharing service is used.

:::

#### `OpenSSH`

Emitted whenever an incoming SSH connection is connected or disconnected.

The event will include:

- The remote IP address of the connection
- The username or UID of the user that connected

:::note

This event is only emitted if the built-in `sshd` is used.

:::

#### `Authentication`

Authentication events

#### `GatekeeperOverride` <AddedBadge added={"macOS 15.0"} /> {#gatekeeper-override}

Emitted whenever a user overrides Gatekeeper for a binary.

The event will indicate:

- The binary path
- The binary's SHA-256 hash, if available
- Details about the binary's code signature, if it is signed

#### `TCCModification` <AddedBadge added={"macOS 15.4"} /> {#tcc-modification}

Emitted whenever the Transparency, Consent, and Control database is modified.
This occurs when an application is granted or denied access to a protected
resource, such as the camera, microphone, or specific folders on disk.

The event will indicate:

- Whether it was a Create/Modify/Delete operation
- The TCC service being modified (e.g. `SystemPolicyDocumentsFolder`, `SystemPolicyAllFiles`, `Microphone`, `Camera`, etc.)
- An identifier for the application being granted/denied access
- The kind of application identifier (e.g. `BUNDLE_ID`, `EXECUTABLE_PATH`)
- Whether access is being granted or denied
- A reason for the change (e.g. `USER_CONSENT`, `MDM_POLICY`)

#### `XProtect` <AddedBadge added={"macOS 15.0"} /> {#xprotect}

Emitted whenever XProtect detects or remediates malware.

The event will indicate:

- The XProtect signature version
- The identifier for the malware that was detected
- The path that it was detected at
- An `incident_identifier`, which can be used to link multiple malware
detected/remediated events together
- If the malware was remediated:
    - The path that was remediated
    - The action taken to remediate it (e.g. `path_delete`)


#### `LaunchItem`

This item is emitted whenever a LaunchAgent, LaunchDaemon, or LoginItem is
registered with the system.

:::info[Prior to macOS 13.3 this event had some bugs that could cause events to be missed]
:::

The event data will indicate:

- Whether an item was added or removed
- The item type (e.g. `AGENT`, `DAEMON`, `LOGIN_ITEM`)
- Whether or not the item is _legacy_
   - When this field is true, the item was registered by placing a
   `launchd.plist` file in the `/Library/LaunchDaemons` or
   `/Library/LaunchAgents` directories, instead of being registered using
   [`SMAppService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice?language=objc)
- The item path, if applicable
- The executable path, if applicable


## Configuration

### Event Selection

The `Telemetry` configuration key allows you to specify which events should be logged.

You can use `Everything` to log all events (this is the default):

```xml
<key>Telemetry</key>
<array>
	<string>Everything</string>
</array>
```

Or select specific events:

```xml
<key>Telemetry</key>
<array>
	<string>Execution</string>
	<string>Authentication</string>
	<string>FileAccess</string>
</array>
```

Or disable logging events:

```xml
<key>Telemetry</key>
<array>
	<string>None</string>
</key>
```

### Log Storage

The `EventLogType` key determines how event logs are stored:

- **file**: Writes events to a file on disk (default)
- **syslog**: Sends events to the macOS Unified Logging System
- **protobuf**: Uses a maildir-like format on disk

   The format of protobuf messages is available in the [proto
   schema](https://github.com/northpolesec/santa/blob/main/Source/common/santa.proto).

- **json**: Writes one JSON object per line to a file

   The format of protobuf messages is available in the [proto
   schema](https://github.com/northpolesec/santa/blob/main/Source/common/santa.proto).

   JSON logs are created by first creating protobuf messages and then converting
   to JSON. Because JSON output requires this conversion, it is a less
   performant option.

- **null**: Disables event logging entirely. Consider setting the `Telemetry`
   key to `none` instead, as this will save Santa from generating events only to
   discard them.

### File Options

Applies when using the `file` log type.

- `EventLogPath`: Path for filelog/JSON output (default: `/var/db/santa/santa.log`)

### Protobuf-based Options

Applies when using the `protobuf` or `json` log types.

- `SpoolDirectory`: Base directory for protobuf format (default: `/var/db/santa/spool`)
- `SpoolDirectoryFileSizeThresholdKB`: Per-file size limit (default: 100KB)
- `SpoolDirectorySizeThresholdMB`: Total spool directory size limit (default: 100MB)
- `SpoolDirectoryEventMaxFlushTimeSec`: Maximum buffer time before flush (default: 10 sec)

### File Change Monitoring

- `FileChangesRegex`: Regex pattern for paths to monitor for file changes
- `FileChangesPrefixFilters`: Path prefixes to exclude from file change
  monitoring. These paths will not be matched against the `FileChangesRegex`,
  which can be a performance improvement for noisy paths.

### Additional Options

- `EnableMachineIDDecoration`: Adds machine ID to filelog entries
- `EntitlementsPrefixFilter`: Entitlement prefixes to exclude from logging
- `EntitlementsTeamIDFilter`: Team IDs whose entitlements should not be logged

## Example Configuration

Here's a complete example configuration for telemetry:

```xml
<key>Telemetry</key>
<array>
    <string>Execution</string>
    <string>Authentication</string>
    <string>FileAccess</string>
</array>
<key>EventLogType</key>
<string>filelog</string>
<key>EventLogPath</key>
<string>/var/log/santa/events.log</string>
<key>FileChangesRegex</key>
<string>^/Users/.*\.sh$</string>
<key>FileChangesPrefixFilters</key>
<array>
    <string>/private/tmp/</string>
</array>
<key>EnableMachineIDDecoration</key>
<true/>
<key>EntitlementsPrefixFilter</key>
<array>
    <string>com.apple.private</string>
</array>
<key>EntitlementsTeamIDFilter</key>
<array>
    <string>platform</string>
</array>
````

This configuration:

- Logs execution, authentication, and file access events
- Writes logs to a custom file location
- Monitors shell script changes in user directories
- Excludes temporary directory changes
- Adds machine ID to log entries
- Filters out private Apple entitlements and platform binary entitlements
