# Anti-Tampering Protection

Santa employs a comprehensive tamper resistance system to protect its critical components from being disabled, modified, or removed by unauthorized processes. This protection ensures the integrity and continuous operation of Santa's security monitoring capabilities.

:::note
Anti-tampering protection is only enabled in release builds. Debug builds do not include this protection to facilitate development and testing.
:::

## Protected Components

Santa's tamper resistance module protects several critical files and paths:

### Database Files
- **Rules Database** (`/private/var/db/santa/rules.db`) - Stores security policies and authorization rules
- **Events Database** (`/private/var/db/santa/events.db`) - Maintains logs of security events

### Configuration Files
- **Sync State** (`/private/var/db/santa/sync-state.plist`) - Maintains synchronization state with management servers

### Application Components
- **Santa Application** (`/Applications/Santa.app/*`) - The entire application bundle is protected using prefix-based protection
- **Launch Agents** (`/Library/LaunchAgents/com.northpolesec.santa.*`) - User-level launch configurations
- **Launch Daemons** (`/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.northpolesec.santa.*`) - System-level launch configurations

### System Components
- **System Extensions** (`/Library/SystemExtensions/*`) - Protects the system extension from tampering
- **Launchctl** (`/bin/launchctl`) - Special handling to prevent misuse against Santa services

## Protection Mechanisms

The tamper resistance system uses Apple's Endpoint Security framework to monitor and block unauthorized operations:

### File System Protection

Santa prevents unauthorized processes from:
- **Deleting** protected files (unlink operations)
- **Renaming** or moving protected files
- **Overwriting** protected files through rename operations
- **Opening for write** any protected file
- **Opening for read** sensitive database files to prevent data exfiltration

When any of these operations are attempted, they are immediately denied and logged with detailed information about the attempting process.

### Process Protection

Santa protects its daemon process from interference:
- **Signal blocking** - All signals sent to the Santa daemon are blocked, except those from launchd (PID 1)
- **Process existence checks** - Signal 0 (used only for checking if a process exists) is allowed
- **Detailed logging** - All blocked signal attempts are logged with source process information

### Launchctl Protection

Santa performs intelligent filtering of launchctl executions:
- **Safe commands allowed** - Read-only commands like `list`, `print`, `help`, `blame`, `hostinfo`, `procinfo`, and `plist` are permitted
- **Service manipulation blocked** - Commands targeting `com.northpolesec.santa.daemon` are denied
- **Command validation** - All launchctl arguments are examined for Santa-related service names

### Legacy Component Detection

Santa actively detects and prevents loading of legacy Google Santa components:
- Monitors for attempts to load legacy plists
- Automatically removes detected legacy components:
  - `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist`
  - `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santa.bundleservice.plist`
  - `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santa.metricservice.plist`
  - `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santa.syncservice.plist`
  - `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.google.santa.plist`
  - `/private/etc/newsyslog.d/com.google.santa.newsyslog.conf`

## Response Actions

When tamper attempts are detected, Santa takes the following actions:

1. **Immediate denial** - The operation is blocked before it can complete
2. **Detailed logging** - Information about the attempt is logged, including:
   - Process ID (PID) of the attempting process
   - Path to the executable attempting the operation
   - Type of operation attempted
   - Target file or process
3. **No caching of denials** - Each tampering attempt is logged individually to ensure complete audit trails
4. **Automatic remediation** - For legacy components, automatic removal prevents conflicts

## Implementation Details

The tamper resistance system is implemented in the `SNTEndpointSecurityTamperResistance` class and uses several key features:

- **Target path watching** - Efficient monitoring by only processing events for protected paths
- **Path type handling** - Supports both literal path matching and prefix-based matching
- **Minimal performance impact** - Focused monitoring reduces system overhead
- **Integration with ES framework** - Leverages macOS security features for robust protection

## Security Considerations

- Protection is bypassed in debug builds to facilitate development
- The Santa daemon itself is allowed to modify protected files for normal operation
- Launchd (PID 1) retains the ability to signal the Santa daemon for system management
- All tamper attempts are logged for security monitoring and incident response
