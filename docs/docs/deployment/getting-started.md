# Getting Started

Due to the security features built-in to macOS, deployment of Santa requires
several pre-requisite steps. It is possible to skip these steps but doing so
will require manual intervention to get Santa running and cause pop-ups that
might be confusing to your users.

It is recommended to go through all of the pages in this section
in order.

If you just want to get Santa running on a single machine for experimentation,
you can skip to the [Install Santa Package](/deployment/install-package) page.
