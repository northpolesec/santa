# Version Support Policies

This document describes North Pole Security's policies on versioning as it
applies to Santa.

### Santa Version

When responding to help requests (in GitHub issues, MacAdmins Slack, etc.) we
will endeavour to support any version that is under 1 year old but we reserve
the right to request updating to the latest version.

### macOS Version

Santa will always support the latest 3 major releases of macOS.

When a new major version of macOS is released we will temporarily support up
to 4 major versions of macOS, for a period of no less than 3 months from the
date of release.

Features that require a new version of macOS may be included in Santa and
disabled on older OS's. Such features will be called out as such.
