# CEL Playground

Test and validate your [CEL expressions](/features/binary-authorization#cel) before deploying them. Enter a CEL expression and provide sample execution context as YAML, then evaluate to see the result and whether it would be cacheable.

See the [CEL expressions cookbook](/cookbook/cel/) for example expressions.

<BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {() => {
    const CELPlayground = require('@site/src/components/CELPlayground').default;
    return <CELPlayground />;
  }}
</BrowserOnly>

:::info
The evaluation is all done inside your browser; the data you input never leaves
your machine.
